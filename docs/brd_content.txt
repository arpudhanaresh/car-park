View available parking lots in real-time
Book preferred slots with instant confirmation
Make secure payments via RinggitPay
Manage bookings directly from their profile
The system is hosted on AWS Cloud ensuring reliability, performance, and data security.
Please review the following section for detailed information on the cancellation process.
1. Cancel Booking Functionality
The system will allow users to cancel a confirmed parking lot booking subject to configurable business rules. This feature enhances user flexibility while protecting the property management from last-minute cancellations.
1.1 Business Rules & Validations
Users can cancel bookings only before the booking start date/time.
Cancellation requests within the last X hours (configurable, e.g., 2 hours before start) will not be allowed.
For refundable bookings, system will trigger refund via RinggitPay API subject to refund policy.
Partial refund percentage can be configured based on cancellation window (e.g., 100% if >24h, 50% if <24h).
Once cancelled, lot becomes immediately available for rebooking.
System logs cancellation event with timestamp and user ID for audit.
Email notification (cancellation confirmation) sent to user and admin.
Non-refundable bookings will show alert message before confirmation.
1.2 Workflow
1. User navigates to ‘My Bookings’ → Selects an active booking → Clicks ‘Cancel’.2. System validates cancellation eligibility (date/time, payment status, refund type).3. If valid, triggers refund process (if applicable) and updates booking status to ‘Cancelled’.4. Email confirmation and refund details sent to user.
1.3 Database & API Impact
Add new field `cancellation_reason` and `cancellation_time` in Booking table.
Update booking status workflow to include ‘Cancelled’.
RinggitPay integration: initiate refund API call with transaction reference.
Refund webhook updates system once refund status is confirmed.
Audit trail maintained in `booking_audit_log` table.
